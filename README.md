# PHOTON - AI/ML Pipeline for Image Categorization

Welcome to **PHOTON**
an advanced AI/ML pipeline designed for categorizing images using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.Built with Python, PHOTON processes single or multiple images using a captioning model (e.g., BLIP) and clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN), providing categorized results. This project is ideal for image organization, research, hackathons, or educational demonstrations.

## Features
- **Multi-Image Support**: Process one or multiple images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) for categorization.
- **AI-Powered Categorization**: Utilizes the BLIP model for image captioning and DBSCAN clustering to group similar images based on caption vectors.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Generates categorized outputs efficiently for analysis or further use.
- **Script-Based Interface**: Command-line driven pipeline for flexibility in AI/ML workflows.
- **Scalable Design**: Optimized for deployment on free platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, suitable for hackathon demos or testing.

## Usage
In the real world, PHOTON's AI/ML pipeline for image categorization and auto-labeling finds practical applications across various domains:
- **Media Libraries**: Stock photo platforms like Shutterstock use PHOTON to automatically categorize and label thousands of images (e.g., "Nature," "Cityscapes"), enhancing searchability for photographers and users.
- **E-commerce**: Online retailers such as Amazon employ PHOTON to organize product images into categories like "Footwear" or "Clothing," auto-labeling them (e.g., "Sneakers," "Dress") for improved inventory management and customer filtering.
- **Social Media**: Platforms like Instagram leverage PHOTON to categorize user-uploaded images (e.g., "Pets," "Events") and auto-label them with flags like "Safe" or "Needs Review" for content moderation.
- **Medical Imaging**: Hospitals apply PHOTON to process X-rays and MRIs, categorizing them into conditions (e.g., "Fracture," "Normal") and auto-labeling for efficient diagnostic support.
- **Surveillance**: Security systems in smart cities use PHOTON to categorize surveillance footage (e.g., "Suspicious Activity," "Normal") and auto-label with alerts like "Threat Detected" for real-time monitoring.
- **Research**: Data scientists utilize PHOTON to prepare datasets by categorizing images (e.g., "Cats," "Dogs") and auto-labeling them for training new machine learning models.
- **Education**: Educational platforms like Khan Academy deploy PHOTON to categorize learning material images (e.g., "Biology," "History") and auto-label them for structured course creation.
- **Wildlife Conservation**: Environmental agencies use PHOTON to categorize wildlife camera images (e.g., "Elephant Herd," "Deforestation") and auto-label them (e.g., "Endangered Species") for conservation tracking.
- **Marketing**: Marketing teams apply PHOTON to categorize campaign images (e.g., "Events," "Testimonials") and auto-label them (e.g., "Spring Campaign") for streamlined asset management.
- **Personal Photo Organization**: Individuals use PHOTON to categorize personal photos (e.g., "Family," "Travel") and auto-label them (e.g., "Weddings," "Holidays") for easier memory management.

These real-world applications demonstrate PHOTON's versatility, making it a valuable tool for automating image organization and labeling across industries.
